	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

	abstract = {Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) is an adaptive method for the online or offline correction of artifacts comprising multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. It repeatedly computes a principal component analysis (PCA) on covariance matrices to detect artifacts based on their statistical properties in the component subspace. We adapted the existing ASR implementation by using Riemannian geometry for covariance matrix processing. EEG data that were recorded on smartphone in both outdoors and indoors conditions were used for evaluation (N = 27). A direct comparison between the original ASR and Riemannian ASR (rASR) was conducted for three performance measures: reduction of eye-blinks (sensitivity), improvement of visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) (specificity), and computation time (efficiency). Compared to ASR, our rASR algorithm performed favorably on all three measures. We conclude that rASR is suitable for the offline and online correction of multichannel EEG data acquired in laboratory and in field conditions.},

abstract = {Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that can translate brain activity patterns into messages or commands for an interactive application. As such, the technology used to design them, and in particular to design passive BCIs, which are a new means to perform mental state monitoring, can greatly benefit the neuroergonomics field. Therefore, this chapter describes the classical structure of the brain signal-processing chain employed in BCIs, notably presenting the typically used preprocessing (spatial and spectral filtering, artifact removal), feature extraction, and classification algorithms. It also gives examples of the use of BCI technology for neuroergonomics applications, either offline for evaluation purposes (e.g., cockpit design or stereoscopic display assessment), or online for adaptation purposes (e.g., video game difficulty level or air traffic controller display adaptation).},

@article{zander2011,
abstract = {Cognitive monitoring is an approach utilizing realtime brain signal decoding (RBSD) for gaining information on the ongoing cognitive user state. In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated RBSD can be used to set up a brain-computer interface (BCI) providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In BCIs the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing BCI technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive BCI. In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive BCI, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from BCI technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with BCI technology is very similar to the concept of BCIs itself we propose a unifying categorization of BCI-based applications, including the novel approach of passive BCI.},

The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility of capturing neural markers of visual attention (P300 Event-Related Potentials) in response to objects embedded in a real-world environment. To this end, electroencephalography and eye-tracking data were recorded while participants attended stimuli presented on a tablet and while they searched for books in a library. Initial analyses of the library data revealed P300-like features shifted in time. A Dynamic Time Warping analysis confirmed the presence of P300 ERP in the library condition. Library data were then lag-corrected based on cross-correlation co-efficients. Together these approaches uncovered P300 ERP responses in the library recordings. These findings high-light the relevance of scalable experimental designs, joint brain and body recordings and template-matching analyses to capture cognitive events during natural behaviours.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.EEGelectroencephalographyE-TEye-TrackingERPEvent-Related PotentialsMoBIMobile Brain/Body ImagingDTWDynamic Time Warping},

abstract="Mental overload and mental fatigue are two degraded cognitive states that are known to promote cognitive incapacitation. We adopted a neuroergonomics approach to investigate these states that remain difficult to induce under laboratory settings thus impeding their measurement. Two experiments were conducted under real flight conditions to respectively measure the electrophysiological correlates of mental fatigue and mental overload with a 32 channel-dry EEG system. Our findings revealed that the occurrence of mental fatigue was related to higher theta and alpha band power. Mental overload was associated with higher beta band power over frontal sites. We performed single trial classification to detect mental fatigue and over-load states. Classification accuracy reached 76.9{\%} and 89.1{\%}, respectively, in discriminating mental fatigue vs. no fatigue and mental overload vs. low-high load. These preliminary results provide evidence for the feasibility of detecting neural correlates of cognitive fatigue and load during real flight conditions and provide promising perspectives on the implementation of neuroadaptive technology especially in the context of single pilot-operation.",

abstract = {Summary
Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular brain activity recording technique used in wide range of applications. One of the commonly faced problems in EEG recordings is the presence of artifacts that come from sources other than brain and contaminate the acquired signals significantly. Therefore, much research over the past 15 years has focused on identifying ways for handling such artifacts in the preprocessing stage. However, this is still an active area of research as no single existing artifact detection/removal method is complete or universal. This article presents an extensive review of the existing state-of-the-art artifact detection and removal methods from scalp EEG for all potential EEG-based applications and analyses the pros and cons of each method. First, a general overview of the different artifact types that are found in scalp EEG and their effect on particular applications are presented. In addition, the methods are compared based on their ability to remove certain types of artifacts and their suitability in relevant applications (only functional comparison is provided not performance evaluation of methods). Finally, the future direction and expected challenges of current research is discussed. Therefore, this review is expected to be helpful for interested researchers who will develop and/or apply artifact handling algorithm/technique in future for their applications as well as for those willing to improve the existing algorithms or propose a new solution in this particular area of research.}

abstract="This chapter presents an introductory overview and a tutorial of signal-processing techniques that can be used to recognize mental states from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in brain--computer interfaces. More particularly, this chapter presents how to extract relevant and robust spectral, spatial, and temporal information from noisy EEG signals (e.g., band-power features, spatial filters such as common spatial patterns or xDAWN, etc.), as well as a few classification algorithms (e.g., linear discriminant analysis) used to classify this information into a class of mental state. It also briefly touches on alternative, but currently less used approaches. The overall objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with practical knowledge about how to analyze EEG signals as well as to stress the key points to understand when performing such an analysis.",
