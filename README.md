Some types of biological data, for instance mobile electroencephalography (EEG) data have been shown to be contaminated strongly by unwanted signals, called artifacts, that are recorded concurrently with the signals of interest. Therefore, many applications dealing with biological data with low signal-to-noise ratio rely on robust artifact correction. For some applications like Brain-Computer-Interfaces, the artifact correction needs to be real-time capable.  Artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) is a statistical method for artifact reduction in EEG. However, in its current implementation, ASR cannot be used in mobile data recordings using limited hardware easily. This repository provides a implementation of ASR fit for translation to C++ by the Matlab Coder and an example openMHA plugin using the C++ version of ASR.
